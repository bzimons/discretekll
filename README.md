#  Discrete Kumaraswamy Log-Logistic regression model 
This paper proposes a discrete Kumaraswamy Log-Logistic regression model for data in
Survival Analysis. Due to lack of discrete probabilistic models, proposing a new class of
distribution, that could fit well to censored data, is interesting. The dataset used on this
paper refers to the Special Social Interest Zone (Zona Especial de Interesse Social - ZEIS).
The proposed model verifies the importance of each variable of Brazilian counties adhering
to the policy ZEIS along the time. Finally, a residual analysis is used in order to verify
the aspect of the fitted model. All analysis were done using software R.
